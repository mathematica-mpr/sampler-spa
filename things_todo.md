Hi Nissa, there is not much to add for v2 besides those items below

## Adding description

-   In backend:

    -   configgraph.json: update graph definition and comparaisn, use a placeholder for the c value in comparaison
    -   Find a way to interpolate c value with what's coming from simulation (possible in both frontend and back end)
    -   ask dhany or Phil Killewald for language around comparaison (it's a diff in diff between the 2 distributions)

-   In Frontend:
    -   Finish description styling

## Graphs

In Frontend: - add axis back
